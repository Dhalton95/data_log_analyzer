# Data Log Analyzer

A python application to read and analze data log files generated by a Cobb Accessport.

## Getting Started

Clone this repository to your local file system

```git clone <repo url>```

## Usage

This application is intended to be run from the command line

### Command Line Arguments

#### Log File

You can pass the path to your log file generated by your access port to the script using the `--log_file` argument. This argument is required; what would this script be doing without a log file? That's kind of the whole point!

```
python analyzer.py --log_file=path/to/your/log
```

#### Headers

Use the `--headers` CLI argument to indicate whether or not the log file contains headers at the top of the file. This will default to `True`.

```
python analyzer.py --log_file=path/to/your/log --headers=False
```
